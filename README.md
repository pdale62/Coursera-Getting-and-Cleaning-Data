# Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data
## Class Project

This is my repository for a class project for [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata). Th project consisted of reading in the ["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), performing an analysis on the data set, and outputing a tidy data set.

**Here are the steps that must be performed before running the R script:**

1. Download the zip file from [this URL](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
2. Unzip the file in the same directory where run_analysis.R script resides.
3. Run the R script ([run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R)).

Note that it requires the [reshape2 package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/index.html), which can be downloaded from CRAN.

The output of the R script is a tidy data set, [tidyDataSet.txt](tidyDataSet.txt).
